Understand Firebase projects:
https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more


A Firebase project (and its associated GCP project) has a project number. This is the Google-assigned globally unique canonical identifier for the project. 
Use this identifier when configuring integrations and/or making API calls to Firebase, Google, or third-party services.

API calls and the project number
For many API calls, you need to include a unique identifier for a project. Although many APIs accept the project ID, 
it's recommended that you use the project number for making API calls to Firebase, Google, or third-party services.

Learn more about using project identifiers, especially the project number, in Google's AIP 2510 standard. --> https://google.aip.dev/cloud/2510




The project ID displays in publicly visible Firebase resources, for example:

Default Hosting subdomain — PROJECT_ID.web.app and PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com
Default Realtime Database URL — PROJECT_ID.firebaseio.com
Default Cloud Storage bucket name — PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
